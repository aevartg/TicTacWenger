# Administration manual


## Introduction:
  This manual explains how to set up TicTacWenger and get it to run on
a fresh machine.

## To install and run the project:

* Download the program zip file and extract it to your machine, if you prefer you can also clone it to your machine using git.
* Open a command line client of your choice and make sure that you are in the root of the TicTacWenger folder.
* Run the command "`sh ./bin/run`". This command deploys and runs the project in your command line client. A runnable jar file is also created in the tmp folder in the root of your operating system. 
* You can also run the jar file straight from the tmp folder using the command "`$ java -jar TicTacWenger.jar`"
