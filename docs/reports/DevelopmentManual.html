</ul></li>
<li><p>Now you can start editing the code! You can use the following commands in the root of the repository. <em>sh ./bin/compile compiles all the java code in the repository </em>sh ./bin/unit_test runs all the unit test from the test directory <em>sh ./bin/clean Deletes the executeable jar file for the program if it exists </em>sh ./bin/package Builds the program and creates executable files *sh ./bin/deploy Is the main build script, cleans up the executable jar file , builds the program , runs the unit tests and creates javadoc documentation for the code. It also converts all the markdown reports into html and places the executeable jar file in the /tmp file in the root of the operating system.</p></li>
